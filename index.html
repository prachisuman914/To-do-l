        <p class="myp">A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do listâ€”but just because you've written your to-dos down doesn't mean your to-do list is actually useful. Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great work done.</p>
